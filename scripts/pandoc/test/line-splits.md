Note that `<T> where T: Deserialize<'static>` is never what you want. Also `Deserialize<'de> + 'static` is
never what you want. Generally writing `'static` anywhere near
`Deserialize` is a sign of being on the wrong track. Use one of the above
bounds instead.

**It will soon be necessary to enable developer mode to run userscripts via Tampermonkey**.\
Instructions
on how to enable it can be found [here](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/userScripts#developer_mode_for_extension_users).\
This release
includes significant updates for future [Manifest V3 compatibility](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/migrating/checklist). Please report
any issues [here](/bug).

So I tried regenerating the lock files using `npm install --package-lock-only` but it attempts and fails to build the entire project when I do that? Wtf?

Sway/flat/erect back — Don’t check this until hip width is correct. (Don’t pin back pattern to bra or you won’t be able to tell if you need a sway/flat/erect back alteration.) For sway/flat/ erect back make a tuck at the center back as deep as needed to make the back hem parallel to the floor, tapering to nothing at the side seam.

Test. This isn’t
right. It’s really not
right.
Yikes! I’m truly a bit
perplexed. This is *very* annoying.

Stephen interrupted. “Doctor, I hope you don’t mind if I tell a story.”

Certainly! You can create a zsh script that uses `mpv` to play video slices based on the specified start and end
timestamps. Here’s a short script that accomplishes this:

To mask the very slow writes to QLC flash, the Crucial P3 Plus operates in SLC mode.
When the drive receives data, it writes each flash cell with a 0 or
1.
This write can finish quickly, then, while idle, the Crucial P3 Plus consolidates the data, reading from SLC and writing in QLC mode.

“So the intended answer to this problem was choice B,
3.
However, the motion of the small circle is not in a straight line, but rather around the large circle.
This revolving action around the large circle contributes an extra revolution as circle A rolls around circle B. Thus, the answer to this question should have been 4, not
3.”
